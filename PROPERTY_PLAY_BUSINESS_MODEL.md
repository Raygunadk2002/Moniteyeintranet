## Financial Calculations

### Monthly Cash Flow Calculation
```
Total Monthly Revenue = Adjusted Rent + Subscription Services + Pay-Per-Visit Services

Where:
- Adjusted Rent = Base Rent √ó (1 + Growth Rate)^Years √ó (1 - Vacancy Rate)
- Subscription Revenue = Œ£(Service Price √ó Expected Tenants)
- Pay-Per-Visit Revenue = Œ£(Price Per Visit √ó Monthly Visits √ó (1 + Growth Rate)^Years)

Total Monthly Expenses = Mortgage Payment + Property Tax + Insurance + 
                        Maintenance + Management Fee + Renovation Payment

Net Monthly Cash Flow = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
```

### Mortgage Payment Formula
```
Monthly Payment = Loan Amount √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
- Loan Amount = Purchase Price √ó (1 - Down Payment %)
- r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12)
- n = Total Number of Payments (Years √ó 12)
```

### Property Value Appreciation
```
Current Property Value = Purchase Price √ó (1 + Appreciation Rate)^Years Since Purchase
```
