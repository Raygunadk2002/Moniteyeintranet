# üìÖ **Easy Calendar Integration Setup**

## üéØ **Option 1: iCal URLs (Recommended - 5 minutes setup)**

Each employee just needs to get their **private iCal URL** from Google Calendar:

### **Step 1: Get Your iCal URL**
1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
2. On the left sidebar, find your main calendar
3. Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)** next to your calendar name
4. Select **"Settings and sharing"**
5. Scroll down to **"Integrate calendar"**
6. Copy the **"Secret address in iCal format"** URL
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this URL private** - it gives access to your calendar

### **Step 2: Send URL to Admin**
Send your iCal URL to Alex with your name:
```
Name: Alex Keal
iCal URL: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/alex%40moniteye.com/private-abc123def456.ics
```

### **Step 3: Admin Adds to Environment**
Alex adds to `.env.local`:
```bash
ALEX_ICAL_URL="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/alex%40moniteye.com/private-abc123def456.ics"
MARK_R_ICAL_URL="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/mark.r%40moniteye.com/private-def456ghi789.ics"
MARK_N_ICAL_URL="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/mark.n%40moniteye.com/private-ghi789jkl012.ics"
RICHARD_ICAL_URL="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/richard%40moniteye.com/private-jkl012mno345.ics"
```

### **‚úÖ That's it!**
