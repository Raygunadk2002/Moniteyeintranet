### 2. **Find Your Calendar**
On the left sidebar, look for your main calendar (usually your email address)

### 3. **Open Settings**
- Click the **3 dots (‚ãÆ)** next to your calendar name
- Select **"Settings and sharing"**

### 4. **Get Your iCal URL**
- Scroll down to the **"Integrate calendar"** section
- Copy the **"Secret address in iCal format"** URL
- It looks like: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/yourname%40moniteye.com/private-ABC123DEF456.ics`

### 5. **Send to Alex**
Email Alex with:
```

iCal URL: [Paste the URL here]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**
- Keep this URL **private** - it gives access to your calendar
- Only Alex needs this URL for the intranet setup
- Your calendar will update automatically in the intranet

## ‚úÖ **That's it!**
Once Alex adds your URL to the system, your calendar will appear in the intranet automatically!
