## üéØ Best Practices

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Test extreme scenarios (¬±50% changes) to understand model resilience
- Focus on parameters with highest impact on profitability
- Use monthly-to-annual growth conversions for sense-checking
- Document assumptions behind parameter ranges

### Scenario Planning
- Always model pessimistic scenarios for risk assessment
- Consider market conditions when setting aggressive targets
- Update scenarios quarterly based on actual performance
- Use scenarios for investor presentations and planning

### Unit Economics
- Target LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or higher for sustainable growth
- Aim for CAC payback period of 12 months or less
- Monitor trends over time, not just point-in-time ratios
- Consider cohort-based LTV calculations for accuracy

### Risk Assessment
- Run Monte Carlo simulations before major decisions
- Use profitability rate to assess business viability
- Consider external factors not captured in the model
- Stress-test assumptions with domain experts

## üîß Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **API**: Next.js API routes for market benchmarks
- **State Management**: React hooks and local state
- **Data Processing**: Real-time calculations with memoization

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized calculations for expensive operations
- Debounced slider updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Lazy loading of market benchmark data
- Efficient chart re-rendering with Chart.js

### Extensibility
- Modular component design for easy feature additions
- Configurable parameter ranges via props
- Pluggable export formats
- API-driven benchmark data for easy updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Requirements

### Database
Run the database migration to enable model persistence:

```sql
-- See fix-business-models-constraints.sql for full migration
ALTER TABLE advanced_business_models 
ADD CONSTRAINT advanced_models_business_idea_unique UNIQUE (business_idea_id);

ALTER TABLE revenue_models 
ADD CONSTRAINT revenue_models_business_idea_unique UNIQUE (business_idea_id);
```

### Environment
No additional environment variables required. The system uses:
- Existing Supabase configuration
- Chart.js (already installed)
- React and TypeScript (already configured)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sensitivity Analysis Not Loading**
- Ensure a business model is configured and saved
- Check that model parameters are properly set
- Verify the baseline model has required fields

**Charts Not Displaying**
- Confirm Chart.js dependencies are installed
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure data arrays are properly formatted

**Market Benchmarks Empty**
- Check `/api/market-benchmarks` endpoint is accessible
- Verify network connectivity
- Review browser console for API errors

**Export Functions Not Working**
- CSV export works out-of-the-box
- PDF export requires jsPDF library integration
- Google Sheets requires API key configuration

### Performance Issues
- Reduce Monte Carlo simulation runs if browser becomes slow
- Use smaller parameter adjustment ranges for faster calculations
- Close other browser tabs if memory usage is high

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
